#  Kata Juggling - Project Euler

No, this is not a secret mission - although it could be. Don't tell anyone... no wait, that's not right. Tell all your friends, because its really quite fun and the more people the better.

##  The "Rules"

1.  Anyone may start coding a [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem in any language. 
2.  The same problem may be solved in the same language as many times as we like.
3.  A breakable rule is start from the first Project Euler problem in any given language and work sequentially.
4.  If you want to introduce your own coding problem that’s awesome.
5.  Code a few lines – the goal is don’t finish it –  then kick it in the internets for someone else to take over.
6.  You can pick up any Kata that you didn’t just code – i.e. a minimum of two people must code.
7.  The second coder is free to finish it, or just to add to it. The idea is code in small increments.
8.  Unit tests are preferable but not  compulsory.
